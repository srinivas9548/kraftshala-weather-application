# Weather App

## Description
A simple weather application built with React that fetches and displays weather data using the Open Weather API.

Additionally, implementing a feature to toggle between dark mode and light mode is encouraged as a bonus.

## Project Requirements
1. User Interface:
Design the UI as per your choice, ensuring it is aesthetically pleasing and intuitive.

    Display the following information:

        1. Current location

        2. Temperature

        3. Date and time

    Provide an input field for users to enter a valid location (city name or zip code).
    Include a button or search functionality to fetch and display weather information for the entered location.

2. API Integration:
Use the Open Weather API to fetch weather data.
Handle API responses and errors gracefully, providing feedback to the user in case of invalid input or connection issues.

## Minimum Requirements
